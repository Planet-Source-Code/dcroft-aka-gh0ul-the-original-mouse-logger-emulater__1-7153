## The Original Mouse Logger\\Emulater


</div>

### Description

You must see this software in action. If you were

dissappointed by previous submissions, you must get this

one! Will log and emulate every event of the mouse anywhere,

in any software. Double clicks, right clicks, Drag and Drop,

Move windows. Thanks to a bug fix by []D[][]V[][]D, the code is

now faster than ever. You can click and drag as normal and

never have to worry about missing a trick. Try it in a text

editor copy a bunch of selected text, paste it somewhere,

then delete it. Replay the movements and watch every move

made as it is replicated in exact form. All data is saved to

file, so it can be replayed again later. Feedback encouraged,

votes appreciated!!
